    <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> All the SPEC results are
    "non-reportable".  The measurements were taken in order to compare
    different compilers and compiler options, not different hardware, please
    do not attempt to make any comparisons of the different machines used.
    Moreover, we have broken various SPEC benchmarking rules, we have even
    patched some benchmark sources to be able to compile them with
    <tt>-fstrict-aliasing</tt>, build with <tt>-fno-common</tt>, and
    so forth.  And the data may be just wrong, the scripts generating
    all the fancy graphs and tables have been known to contain bugs in
    the past.  On the other hand, this is the data that we use to
    evaluate where GCC stands and we believe that overall this
    comparison of compilers is a useful one.
